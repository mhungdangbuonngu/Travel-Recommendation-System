This is a guide to output the text in the output.txt file in real time for demonstration purpose


Since cmd doesn't support monitoring a file in realtime we will need to use powershell

#this one create the output.txt:
New-Item output.txt -ItemType File

#this one display it in realtime:
Get-Content output.txt -Wait

After setting this up in the powershell, we can now run the script and see the result in powershell. Or just open up the text file after speaking which ever works.
